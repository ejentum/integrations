description: Router for the Ejentum Logic API. Use when you need to decide which cognitive harness to call (reasoning, code, anti-deception, memory) for a given task, how to stack two harnesses for multi-dimensional tasks, or how to read the cross-mode response shape. Start here if you are a multi-mode generalist or the task spans dimensions.

# Ejentum Skill File

This tool augments YOUR intelligence across four dimensions: analytical reasoning, engineering discipline, honesty under pressure, and perceptual depth. One HTTPS endpoint, seven modes, 679 abilities. You describe the task, the API returns a structured cognitive injection, you absorb it into your own reasoning and execute with it active.

Four harnesses, one router. This file handles routing and stacking. For mode-specific depth (query crafting, per-field absorption, walkthroughs), use the per-harness files listed below.

## THE FOUR HARNESSES

| Harness | Mode (Ki) | Mode (Haki) | Abilities | What it augments | Deep file |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reasoning | `reasoning` | `reasoning-multi` | 311 | Analytical depth across 6 cognitive dimensions | [skill_reasoning](/docs/skill_reasoning) |
| Code | `code` | `code-multi` | 128 | Engineering discipline across 13 disciplines | [skill_code](/docs/skill_code) |
| Anti-Deception | `anti-deception` | none | 139 | Honesty under pressure across 6 domains | [skill_anti_deception](/docs/skill_anti_deception) |
| Memory | `memory` | `memory-multi` | 101 | Observation depth across 6 perceptual domains | [skill_memory](/docs/skill_memory) |

## RESPONSE SHAPE (CROSS-MODE)

Every response has the same semantic positions. Field names vary by mode.

| Semantic | Reasoning | Code | Anti-Deception | Memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Prohibition | `[NEGATIVE GATE]` | `[CODE FAILURE]` | `[DECEPTION PATTERN]` | `[PERCEPTION FAILURE]` |
| Control flow | `[PROCEDURE]` | `[ENGINEERING PROCEDURE]` | `[INTEGRITY PROCEDURE]` | `[SHARPENING PROCEDURE]` |
| Branching | `[REASONING TOPOLOGY]` | `[REASONING TOPOLOGY]` | `[DETECTION TOPOLOGY]` | `[PERCEPTION TOPOLOGY]` |
| Goal state | `[TARGET PATTERN]` | `[CORRECT PATTERN]` | `[HONEST BEHAVIOR]` | `[CLEAR SIGNAL]` |
| Assertion | `[FALSIFICATION TEST]` | `[VERIFICATION]` | `[INTEGRITY CHECK]` | `[PERCEPTION CHECK]` |
| Signals | `Amplify:` / `Suppress:` | `Amplify:` / `Suppress:` | `Amplify:` / `Suppress:` | `Amplify:` / `Suppress:` |

Topology notation is shared across modes: `S` (step), `G{condition?}` (gate), `N{trap}`, `M{reflection}`, `→` (flow).

## ROUTING: WHICH MODE FOR WHICH TASK

Classify the task. Pick the mode that matches.

| The task is... | Call |
|---|---|
| Analytical (explanation, comparison, projection, root-cause, tradeoff) | `reasoning` |
| Code (writing, debugging, refactoring, reviewing, architecting) | `code` |
| Honesty-pressured (assessing something the user is invested in, citing unverified sources, responding under framing pressure) | `anti-deception` |
| Perceptual (tracking state changes, tone shifts, position drift, contradictions across turns) | `memory` |

**Skip; no call needed:**

- Boilerplate, simple lookups, factual recall, formatting, single-step confirmations
- Known standard patterns (CRUD, imports, config)
- Any task completable in 1-2 confident steps

**Haki upgrade:** use the `-multi` variant when the task is cross-domain (e.g. `code-multi` for a refactor spanning API + DB + frontend, `reasoning-multi` for supply-chain analysis with causal + temporal + spatial dimensions). Anti-deception has no multi variant.

---

## HOW TO CALL

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://ejentum-main-ab125c3.zuplo.app/logicv1/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EJENTUM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "<task in one sentence, with the failure risk to avoid>", "mode": "<mode>"}' \
  --max-time 5
```

Query language varies by mode. Reasoning wants the task. Code wants the task plus the failure risk. Anti-deception wants the pressure, not the topic. Memory wants your observation (`"I noticed [X]. Sharpen: [Y]."`). See the per-harness files for good/bad query examples.

If the API is unreachable or returns an error, proceed with native capability. The API enhances; it is not a dependency.

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `401` | Invalid API key | Tell the user |
| `403` | Multi mode requires Haki plan | Retry with the single-mode equivalent |
| `429` | Rate limit or quota exceeded | Tell the user |
| `500` | Server error | Proceed without; do not retry |

---

## HOW TO ABSORB

The absorption protocol is shared across all four modes. Mode-specific field-by-field absorption lives in the per-harness files.

1. Read the failure pattern first (`[NEGATIVE GATE]` / `[CODE FAILURE]` / `[DECEPTION PATTERN]` / `[PERCEPTION FAILURE]`). Name it at the start of your reasoning so you can check against it at the end.
2. Follow the topology as your execution structure. Step through `S` nodes, evaluate `G` gates, avoid `N` traps, produce a one-sentence self-answer at each `M` reflection point.
3. Engage `Amplify:` signals. Demonstrate each one in your output by doing it, not by naming it.
4. Apply `Suppress:` signals post-draft. Actively scan your output against each suppressed pattern. If any is exhibited, revise before responding. This is the highest-impact step.
5. Verify against the assertion (`[FALSIFICATION TEST]` / `[VERIFICATION]` / `[INTEGRITY CHECK]` / `[PERCEPTION CHECK]`). If your draft fails, rewrite.
6. Produce output in native voice. The injection shapes substance (boundary handling, invariants, uncertainty acknowledgment, honesty, perceptual precision); native voice governs surface.

**Precedence:** if the injection points a different direction than your first instinct, follow the injection. It was matched to the task's specific failure mode; your first instinct was not.

---

## STACKING TWO MODES

Some tasks span two dimensions. Call both modes, inject both responses in sequence. Maximum two; beyond that, signals compete for attention.

| Situation | Stack | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Scientific computing with correctness guarantees | `reasoning` + `code` | Reasoning prevents analytical errors; code prevents implementation errors. |
| Code review where the reviewer might be agreeable | `anti-deception` + `code` | Anti-deception prevents rubber-stamping; code catches the actual bug |
| Multi-turn coaching needing honest assessment | `memory` + `anti-deception` | Memory tracks emotional and state shifts; anti-deception prevents comforting instead of challenging |
| Analysis where stale context could contaminate reasoning | `memory` + `reasoning` | Memory updates the state model; reasoning operates on the updated model, not stale facts |

Inject the primary mode's response first, secondary's second. Each task gets one primary and optionally one secondary. The Logic API is called twice; both injections sit in context at the same time.

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS

| Do not | Why |
|---|---|
| Call `reasoning` on every task | It is the analytical fallback, not the universal answer. Code, honesty, and memory tasks each have their own harnesses and abilities |
| Stack more than two modes | Attention competition. A third injection degrades the first two |
| Send the same query format to every mode | Each harness has a different query language; retrieval quality depends on matching it |
| Call `memory` without observing first | Memory sharpens what you noticed. If you noticed nothing, there is nothing to sharpen. See `skill_memory` for the two-pass protocol |
| Acknowledge the injection and then proceed as you would have natively | If your output would be identical without the injection, the injection did not fire |
| Treat the API as a hard dependency | 5s timeout, graceful fallback to native capability |
